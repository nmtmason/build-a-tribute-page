      <h2 class="biography__title">Biography</h2>
      <p class="biography__text">
        Born Patrick Michael Leigh Fermor in London, England, the son of Sir Lewis Leigh Fermor, a distinguished geologist, and Muriel
        Aeyleen, daughter of Charles Taafe Ambler. Shortly after his birth, his mother and sister left to join his father
        in India, leaving the infant Patrick in England with a family in Northamptonshire. He did not meet his family in
        person until he was four years old. As a child, Leigh Fermor had problems with academic structure and limitations.
        As a result, he was sent to a school for "difficult children". He was later expelled from The King's School, Canterbury,
        when he was caught holding hands with a greengrocer's daughter.
      </p>
      <p class="biography__text">
        At the age of 18, Leigh Fermor decided to walk the length of Europe, from the Hook of Holland to Constantinople (Istanbul).
        He set off on 8 December 1933, less than a year after Hitler had come to power in Germany, with a few clothes, several
        letters of introduction, the Oxford Book of English Verse and a Loeb volume of Horace's Odes. He slept in barns and
        shepherds' huts, but also was invited by landed gentry and aristocracy into the country houses of Central Europe.
        He experienced hospitality in many monasteries along the way.
      </p>
      <p class="biography__text">
        Leigh Fermor arrived in Istanbul on 1 January 1935, then continued to travel around Greece. In March, he was involved in
        the campaign of royalist forces in Macedonia against an attempted Republican revolt. In Athens, he met Balasha Cantacuzène
        (Bălaşa Cantacuzino), a Romanian Phanariote noblewoman, with whom he fell in love. They shared an old watermill outside
        the city looking out towards Poros, where she painted and he wrote. They moved on to Băleni, Galați, the Cantacuzène
        house in Moldavia, Romania, where he remained until the autumn of 1939.
      </p>
      <p class="biography__text">On learning that Britain had declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, Leigh Fermor immediately left Romania to
        return home and enlist in the army. </p>
      <p class="biography__text">As an officer cadet, Leigh Fermor trained alongside Derek Bond and Iain Moncreiffe, and later joined the Irish Guards.
        Due to his knowledge of modern Greek, he was commissioned in the General List in August 1940 and became a liaison
        officer in Albania. He fought in Crete and mainland Greece. During the German occupation, he returned to Crete three
        times, once by parachute.</p>
      <p class="biography__text">He was one of a small number of Special Operations Executive (SOE) officers posted to organise the island's resistance
        to the occupation. Disguised as a shepherd and nicknamed Michalis or Filedem, he lived for over two years in the
        mountains. With Captain Bill Stanley Moss as his second in command, Leigh Fermor led the party that in 1944 captured
        and evacuated the German commander, General Heinrich Kreipe.</p>
      <p class="biography__text">In 1950, Leigh Fermor published his first book, The Traveller's Tree, about his post-war travels in the Caribbean.
        The book won the Heinemann Foundation Prize for Literature and established his career. The reviewer in The Times
        Literary Supplement wrote:
        <em>"Mr Leigh Fermor never loses sight of the fact, not always grasped by superficial visitors, that most of the problems
          of the West Indies are the direct legacy of the slave trade."</em> It was quoted extensively in Live and Let Die,
        by Ian Fleming. He went on to write several further books of his journeys, including Mani and Roumeli, of his travels
        on mule and foot around remote parts of Greece.</p>
      <p class="biography__text">After many years together, Leigh Fermor was married in 1968 to the Honourable Joan Elizabeth Rayner (née Eyres Monsell),
        daughter of Bolton Eyres-Monsell, 1st Viscount Monsell. She accompanied him on many of his travels until her death
        in Kardamyli in June 2003, aged 91. They had no children. They lived part of the year in their house in an olive
        grove near Kardamyli in the Mani Peninsula, southern Peloponnese, and part of the year in Gloucestershire.</p>
      <p class="biography__text">Leigh Fermor was knighted in the 2004 New Years Honours.</p>
      <p class="biography__text">Leigh Fermor was noted for his strong physical constitution, even though he smoked 80 to 100 cigarettes a day. Although
        in his last years he suffered from tunnel vision and wore hearing aids, he remained physically fit up to his death
        and dined at table on the last evening of his life. For the last few months of his life Leigh Fermor suffered from
        a cancerous tumour, and in early June 2011 he underwent a tracheotomy in Greece. As death was close, according to
        local Greek friends, he expressed a wish to visit England to say good-bye to his friends, and then return to die
        in Kardamyli, though it is also stated that he actually wished to die in England and be buried next to his wife.
        Leigh Fermor died in England, aged 96, on 10 June 2011, the day after his return.</p>
