      <p class="biography__text">
        Born Patrick Michael Leigh Fermor in London, England, the son of Sir Lewis Leigh Fermor, a distinguished geologist, and Muriel
        Aeyleen, daughter of Charles Taafe Ambler. Shortly after his birth, his mother and sister left to join his father
        in India, leaving the infant Patrick in England with a family in Northamptonshire. He did not meet his family in
        person until he was four years old. As a child, Leigh Fermor had problems with academic structure and limitations.
        As a result, he was sent to a school for "difficult children". He was later expelled from The King's School, Canterbury,
        when he was caught holding hands with a greengrocer's daughter.

      <p class="biography__text">
        At the age of 18, Leigh Fermor decided to walk the length of Europe, from the Hook of Holland to Constantinople (Istanbul).
        He set off on 8 December 1933, less than a year after Hitler had come to power in Germany, with a few clothes, several
        letters of introduction, the Oxford Book of English Verse and a Loeb volume of Horace's Odes. He slept in barns and
        shepherds' huts, but also was invited by landed gentry and aristocracy into the country houses of Central Europe.
        He experienced hospitality in many monasteries along the way.
      </p>
      <p class="biography__text">
        Leigh Fermor arrived in Istanbul on 1 January 1935, then continued to travel around Greece. In March, he was involved in
        the campaign of royalist forces in Macedonia against an attempted Republican revolt. In Athens, he met Balasha Cantacuzène
        (Bălaşa Cantacuzino), a Romanian Phanariote noblewoman, with whom he fell in love. They shared an old watermill outside
        the city looking out towards Poros, where she painted and he wrote. They moved on to Băleni, Galați, the Cantacuzène
        house in Moldavia, Romania, where he remained until the autumn of 1939.
      </p>
      <p class="biography__text">On learning that Britain had declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, Leigh Fermor immediately left Romania to
        return home and enlist in the army. </p>
